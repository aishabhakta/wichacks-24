## What is GDM?

- **Definition:** Hyperglycemia first recognized in pregnancy, typically **24–28 weeks**, usually resolves postpartum.
- **Mechanism:** Pregnancy-induced **insulin resistance** (placental hormones) + **inadequate β-cell compensation** → elevated glucose.
- **Prevalence:** ~**9%** globally; rising with maternal age, adiposity, and inactivity.
- **Major risks:** Maternal **T2DM** and **CVD** later; fetal **macrosomia**, shoulder dystocia; neonatal **hypoglycemia**; long-term offspring risks (obesity, insulin resistance, early CVD).

---

## Risk Factors

- Pre-pregnancy **overweight/obesity**, excessive gestational weight gain
- **Advanced maternal age**
- **Family history** of diabetes
- Prior GDM or macrosomic infant
- Sedentary lifestyle and metabolic syndrome features

---

## Screening & Diagnosis

- Screen **24–28 weeks** (earlier if high risk).
- Approaches:
  - **Two-step:** 50-g GCT → if positive, 100-g OGTT
  - **One-step:** 75-g OGTT (may diagnose more cases)
- Postpartum **4–12 weeks:** 75-g OGTT to assess for **type 2 diabetes** or prediabetes.

---

## Maternal Effects

- **Short-term:** Hypertension/preeclampsia, higher CS rates, prolonged labor, PPH (with macrosomia), infections.
- **Long-term:** ↑ risk **T2DM** (≈10% soon postpartum; **20–60%** within 5–10 yrs without intervention), metabolic syndrome, ↑ lifetime **CVD** risk.

---

## Fetal / Neonatal Effects

- **Macrosomia** (15–45%): central adiposity (abdomen/shoulders); ↑ birth trauma.
- **Shoulder dystocia**, **brachial plexus injury** (Erb’s palsy).
- **Neonatal hypoglycemia**, respiratory distress, hyperbilirubinemia/jaundice, NICU admission.
- Potential increase in congenital anomalies mainly linked with **pre-existing diabetes**; association with GDM less consistent.

---

## Offspring: Childhood → Adult Outcomes

- ↑ **obesity**, **insulin resistance**, **T2DM** risk; adverse cardiometabolic profile (↑ BMI/waist, triglycerides, HOMA-IR).
- ↑ early-onset **CVD** (arrhythmias, HTN, VTE, HF) reported in large cohorts.

## Management Overview

**Primary goal:** Maintain maternal euglycemia to reduce maternal/fetal complications.

### Glucose Targets (typical clinical targets)

- **Fasting:** ≤ **95 mg/dL**
- **1-hour post-meal:** ≤ **140 mg/dL**
- **2-hour post-meal:** ≤ **120 mg/dL**
- At-home self-monitoring: fasting + postprandials; A1C less useful in GDM.

### Lifestyle First-Line (effective for ~70–85%)

- **Medical nutrition therapy**: balanced portions; complex carbs; healthy fats; ~**20% protein**; manage total carbohydrates and distribution.
- **Physical activity**: regular moderate exercise improves glycemia and pregnancy outcomes; supports postpartum weight goals and mood.

### Pharmacotherapy (≈15–30% require)

- **Insulin**: preferred, does **not** cross placenta.
- **Oral agents**: **metformin** and **glyburide** can cross placenta; used in some settings—discuss benefits/risks with clinician.

### Labor & Delivery Considerations

- Anticipate macrosomia; assess mode of delivery risk (shoulder dystocia, perineal trauma, PPH).

---

## Lactation & Early Postpartum

- Encourage **breastfeeding** (maternal metabolic benefits; neonatal protection).
- Some women with GDM may have **delayed lactogenesis** and altered milk immunologic profile—lactation support helps.

---

## Postpartum Follow-Up (Mother)

- **4–12 weeks OGTT** for T2DM screening; then **q 1–3 years** lifelong screening.
- Address weight management, physical activity, cardiometabolic risk reduction (BP, lipids).
- Plan contraception mindful of metabolic/VTE risks; support interpregnancy weight goals.

---

## Practical Counseling Points

- Explain targets and monitoring plan; provide meal templates and movement ideas.
- Review **warning signs** (e.g., headache/vision changes for preeclampsia; reduced fetal movement).
- Coordinate multidisciplinary care (OB, MFM, diabetes educator, dietitian, pediatrics).

---

## Key Takeaways

- GDM = insulin resistance + inadequate β-cell response during pregnancy.
- Treating hyperglycemia with **diet, activity, and medications** when needed reduces perinatal risks.
- **Postpartum OGTT** is essential—GDM signals high future **T2DM/CVD** risk.
- Offspring of GDM pregnancies have elevated **obesity/insulin resistance/CVD** risks → emphasize prevention across the life course.
