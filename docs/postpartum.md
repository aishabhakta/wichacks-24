## Overview

- The **postpartum period** begins immediately after delivery and typically lasts **6–8 weeks**, ending when the mother’s body approaches the pre-pregnant state.
- Most maternal and infant deaths occur in the **first month**; reliable, continuous postpartum care is critical.

---

## Timing & Model of Care

- **ACOG (2018)**: replace a single 6-week visit with **ongoing care through 12 weeks**.
  - Contact within **3 weeks** (in person or by phone), ongoing follow-up as needed, and a **comprehensive visit by ≤12 weeks**.

## Core Components of Postpartum Care

### Pain & Perineal Healing

- Mild tears heal in weeks; extensive tears take longer.
- OTC analgesics (ibuprofen/acetaminophen), cushioned seating, cold/ice as needed.
- Educate on **infection signs** (fever, worsening pain) and when to seek care.

### Bleeding/Lochia

- **Rubra (days 1–3/4)** → **Serosa (pink-brown)** → **Alba (yellow-white ~day 10–12)**.
- **Urgent evaluation** for heavy bleeding (soaking ≥1 pad/hour), retained placenta, uterine atony, coagulation issues, or **endometritis** (fever, uterine tenderness, discharge).

### Breastfeeding

- Benefits mother and infant; assess **latch, swallow, nipple, positioning** each visit.
- Encourage unless contraindicated; WHO supports exclusive breastfeeding for **~4–6 months**.
- Consider lactation consultant, peer/professional support.

### Nutrition & Activity

- Higher risk of weight retention with excessive GWG, lower SES, and in some populations; increases future **obesity/T2DM** risk.
- **Breastfeeding moms**: ~**+500 kcal/day**.
- Rest 2–3 weeks; begin **low-impact activity** (e.g., walking), gradual return thereafter.

### Breast Engorgement

- Prevent with **frequent feeding** on both sides.
- Warm shower/compress before feeds; cold between feeds for pain.
- If **not** breastfeeding: cold packs, firm support, analgesics; avoid expression unless clinically indicated.

### Bladder/Bowel

- Encourage regular **voiding**; avoid overfilling.
- If no bowel movement by day 3: consider **stool softener** (e.g., docusate), fiber/psyllium; osmotics (PEG, lactulose) as needed.

### Sexual Health

- **Libido** may be reduced (especially with lactation); reassurance is appropriate.
- Resume intercourse after perineal healing (~**4–6 weeks**); discuss comfort, lubrication, and timing.

### Contraception

- Start counseling **prenatally**.
- **Breastfeeding**: prefer **nonhormonal** or **progestin-only** methods; avoid combined estrogen-progestin early due to milk supply & VTE risk.
- Typical timings:
  - Combined hormonal: **≥3 weeks** postpartum (VTE risk) and when not breastfeeding; often later if lactating.
  - Diaphragm/cervical cap: fit at **6–8 weeks** after uterine involution.
  - IUDs: often **≥4–6 weeks** postpartum (per local practice).
- **LAM** (lactational amenorrhea) has criteria and is time-limited (<6 months, exclusive demand breastfeeding, amenorrhea).

### Education & Loss Support

- Teach newborn care (cord, bathing, immunizations).
- For miscarriage/stillbirth/neonatal death: ensure follow-up, **bereavement support**, results review, and future planning.

## Common Postpartum Concerns

### Postpartum Blues

- Transient mood symptoms in week 1; usually **resolve by 2 weeks**.
- Screen with validated tools (e.g., **EPDS**) at well visits (AAP: 1, 2, 4, 6 months).
- **Escalate** if symptoms persist >2 weeks, impair function, or involve thoughts of self-harm/infant harm.

### Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

- Screen (e.g., **HARK**, **HITS**); prioritize safety and referrals.

### Incontinence

- **Stress urinary incontinence** is common; risk factors include obesity, parity, smoking, forceps.
- First-line: **pelvic floor (Kegel) training**, bladder training, weight management.

### Hemorrhoids

- Common from constipation or pushing; increase fluids/fiber, use stool softeners; escalate refractory cases.

## Clinical Significance & Disparities

- ≈**40%** of women do not receive postpartum care; barriers include socioeconomic, insurance, cultural, access, and systemic factors.
- Early risks (first week): **severe hypertension, hemorrhage, infection**; later: **cardiovascular** causes.
- Emphasize early contacts and chronic disease follow-up to reduce morbidity/mortality; address inequities (e.g., higher mortality among non-Hispanic Black women).

## Medical Issues Emerging or Persisting Postpartum

1. **Hypertensive disorders**: visit within **7 days**; treat ≥150/100 with oral agents (e.g., nifedipine, labetalol); **hospitalize** for end-organ signs or ≥160/110.
2. **Gestational diabetes**: **75-g OGTT at 4–12 weeks** postpartum to screen for **type 2 diabetes**.
3. **Thyroid disease**: postpartum thyroiditis (hyper often transient; beta-blockers for symptoms). Treat hypothyroidism with **levothyroxine**; consider **annual testing** if history of postpartum thyroiditis.

## WHO Postnatal Care Highlights

1. Provide **postnatal care in first 24 h** to all mothers/newborns, regardless of birthplace.
2. Healthy dyads should **remain ≥24 h** in facility after birth.
3. At least **4 visits in first 6 weeks**: day 3 (48–72 h), days 7–14, and 6 weeks (and earlier if at home birth: within 24 h).
4. Educate on normal recovery and **warning signs** (infection, PPH, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, VTE).
5. Prophylactic **antibiotics** recommended for **3rd/4th-degree tears**.
6. In high-neonatal-mortality settings, daily **topical chlorhexidine** to umbilical stump for the first week (for home births).

## Key Takeaways

- Replace the single 6-week check with **continuous care up to 12 weeks**.
- **Early contact** (≤3 weeks) and vigilance for hemorrhage, infection, & hypertension save lives.
- Screen for **mood disorders** and **IPV**; normalize pelvic floor rehab.
- Provide **contraception counseling** and chronic disease follow-up (HTN, GDM, thyroid).
- Address access and equity barriers to improve outcomes.
