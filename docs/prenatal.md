## Overview

Prenatal care (PNC) is one of the most common U.S. health interventions (~50M visits/year).  
Despite widespread use, U.S. infant mortality remains high and disparities persist.  
This review synthesizes 36 studies exploring **women’s experiences of prenatal care** to inform women-centered models.

## Key Findings

### General Experience

- Experiences were **mixed**: some women reported respectful, individualized care; others described rushed, mechanistic, or harsh encounters.
- **Low income and minority women** were more likely to encounter barriers, discrimination, and negative interpersonal treatment.

### Core Themes (Features of Care)

Six recurring features shaped women’s experience:

1. **Incentives & Barriers**
   - _Benefits_: assurance of healthy pregnancy, hearing fetal heartbeat, ultrasounds, education, social connection.
   - _Barriers_: long waits, transportation, childcare needs, cost/insurance gaps, fear of exams/tests.
2. **Setting**
   - Women valued clean, welcoming environments with privacy, flexible scheduling, partner inclusion, and child-friendly spaces.
3. **Time Spent**
   - Desired **reasonable waits (<30 min)** and **unhurried visits**.
   - Long waits for brief visits strongly reduced satisfaction.
4. **Components of Care**
   - **Continuity**: seeing a single provider or small team improved trust, satisfaction, and follow-through.
   - **Comprehensiveness**: inclusion of social, psychological, and educational services enhanced experience.
   - **Control**: women valued shared decision-making, proactive offers of choices, and involvement of partners.
5. **Relationships with Staff & Clinicians**
   - Key sub-themes: clear language, respect, individualized attention, caring interactions, and open communication.
   - Negative experiences included rudeness, stereotyping (race, income, Medicaid), and use of medical jargon.
6. **Information Sharing**
   - Desired detailed explanations about pregnancy, self-care, labor, infant care, and family planning.
   - Dissatisfaction arose when information was incomplete, rushed, or not tailored to personal concerns.

## Vulnerable Populations

- **Low income & minority women** often faced:
  - External obstacles (transport, childcare, insurance gaps).
  - Internal barriers (long waits, disrespect, fear of procedures).
  - Stereotyping and discriminatory treatment.
- Many performed a “cost-benefit” analysis, sometimes skipping care when barriers outweighed perceived benefits.

## Care Models & Innovations

- **Group PNC (e.g., CenteringPregnancy)** provided:
  - Longer sessions (90–120 min)
  - Peer support
  - More education
  - Greater clinician contact time  
    → Higher satisfaction, improved prenatal knowledge, reduced preterm birth, increased breastfeeding initiation.

---

## Policy & Clinical Implications

- **Ask women directly** about needs/preferences; tailor care.
- Provide **longer visits**, flexible scheduling, and explanations for delays.
- Increase **continuity** of provider relationships.
- Offer **coordinated ancillary services** (psychosocial, nutritional, education).
- Advocate for **structural changes**: expanded insurance, culturally competent care, welcoming environments.

---

## Research Gaps

- Limited comprehensive data on women's overall experiences.
- Need for rigorous instruments to measure experience beyond “satisfaction.”
- More large-scale, multi-site studies comparing models of care and their impact on maternal/infant outcomes.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Positive PNC requires **time, respect, and relationship-building**, not just biomedical monitoring.
- Reducing barriers and implementing women-centered, group-based care can improve both **experience** and **pregnancy outcomes**.
