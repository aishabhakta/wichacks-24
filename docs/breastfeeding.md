## Definition / Introduction

- Breastfeeding provides complete early nutrition and supports bonding. Recommended exclusively for ~6 months; maternal milk is crucial for development.
- Hormonal control: **oxytocin** and **prolactin** drive milk production and let-down.
- **Colostrum** (immediately postpartum): high protein, sodium, immunoglobulins; lower lactose. By ~30–40 hours, lactose increases as milk volume rises.
- **Vitamin D** supplementation: start in first days of life (400 IU/day; increase to 600 IU/day at age 1).
- Maintenance is demand-driven: frequent **suckling and emptying** sustain supply.

## Early Initiation & Latch

- **Skin-to-skin** in the first 2 hours helps initiate lactation; the newborn “**breast crawl**” supports bonding and first latch.
- Success factors: alert infant, intact rooting/suckling reflexes, and **proper latch/positioning** (often needs coaching).
- Barriers: pain, anxiety, emotional stress—address early; involve lactation consultants and supportive partners/family.

## Medication Considerations

- Most medications have **compatible alternatives**; complete cessation is rarely required. Review meds during lactation and switch to safer options as needed.

## Clinical Significance

- **Colostrum** provides mucosal immunity (**sIgA**, IgM, IgG)—often called the “first immunization.”
- Milk microbiota (**Bifidobacterium**, **Lactobacillus**) + oligosaccharides support gut defense and vitamin synthesis (B12, B6, K, folate).
- **Lactoferrin** in milk inhibits pathogens by limiting iron availability.
- **Foremilk**: more lactose; **hindmilk**: more fat/protein—overall composition adapts to infant needs.
- Benefits associated with breastfeeding: lower risk of URIs and diarrhea; possible reductions in asthma, T1D, food allergies, obesity. May delay menstruation and reduce costs.
- Public health: initiation is common, but continuation drops within months—ongoing support matters.

## Practical Support

- Ensure **effective latch**; evaluate for tongue/lip tie if persistent nipple pain or trauma.
- Offer **lactation consultant** support during the hospital stay and after discharge.
- Monitor parental mental health (e.g., **postpartum depression**) as it can deter breastfeeding.

## Breast Milk Jaundice (brief)

- Some regimens (e.g., short, limited formula supplementation or chicory-based approaches reported in small studies) have been used to normalize bilirubin; decisions should be clinician-guided. Do **not** continue supplementation once bilirubin normalizes unless advised.

## Key Takeaways

- Start skin-to-skin early; focus on positioning and latch.
- Feed on demand; empty breasts frequently to maintain supply.
- Begin infant **vitamin D** supplementation early.
- Seek lactation support and screen for parental mood disorders.
- Most meds have lactation-safe alternatives—consult a clinician.
